PlainTests:
this folder includes only the excel output results of some of the more lengthy and extensive tests as it's generally very difficult to operate the JMeter app to generate Dashboard reports for more than 3000 users; it takes too much time and ends up crashing the whole PC.


TestPlans:
full-blown tests testing the homepage, profile and feed with up to 3000 users
The reports include full graphical reports that provide the following:

They provide a visual representation of the performance data collected during the execution of a test plan. These reports can include a variety of charts and graphs that help you understand the behavior of your application under different loads.

Here are some of the key features of JMeter's graphical reports:

Summary Report: Provides a table with statistics for each request in your test, including the number of samples, average response time, min/max response time, error rate, and more.

Graph Results: Shows a simple graph with the response times of all samples. The X-axis represents the time, and the Y-axis represents the response time.

Response Time Graph: Shows a line graph of the response times over time. You can see how the response time changes as the load increases.

Throughput Graph: Shows a line graph of the number of requests per second over time. This can help you understand the capacity of your server.

Latency vs Throughput: This graph helps you understand the relationship between the latency (response time) and the throughput (number of requests per second).

Response Time Percentiles: Shows a bar chart of the response time percentiles. This can help you understand the distribution of response times.
